## About Me

I'm a high school nerd who is passionate about all things Music and Technology, especially at the intersection of the two.

This blog will most likely cover a lot of Cybersecurity-flavored explorations of these, but I'll also be posting about other things that I find interesting.

Feel free to check out the site's [GitHub issues page]() if you want to start a conversation about anything you see here, or just say hi! (I promise it's a temporary solution until I figure out how to set up a comments section.)

Enjoy!
