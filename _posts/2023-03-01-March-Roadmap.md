Hello everyone! I've been busy with my [Senior Project](https://basisseniorprojects.com/scottsdale/author/sakethr/) for the last month, so that's the backlog I'll be uploading to here for the next few weeks. If you want to preview the posts, you can visit [my official SRP page](https://basisseniorprojects.com/scottsdale/author/sakethr/) (ignore the awful photo lol).

## Current Posting Schedule Plan:

- I currently want to push out the content I've been writing on a one-month delay. So, for example, if I write a post on 3/1 for my official SRP Blog, I'll publish it here on 4/1. Not all of the posts are winners (I'm still learning how to write), but I think they're all interesting enough to share. I'll also be adding a few more posts to the backlog, so I'll be posting more frequently than I have been.

## Other misc. updates to the site that I want to implement/ have planned:

- [ ] The cool "on hover" footnotes like what the [MIT Blog](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/we-are-reinstating-our-sat-act-requirement-for-future-admissions-cycles/) has
- [ ] A way to subscribe to the blog

## Other notes:

I'm fairly new to blogging, so I'm always looking to improve my content and this site. Thanks for reading!
