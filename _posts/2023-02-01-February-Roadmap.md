Hello everyone! Over the last month, I've been working on building a backlog so that I can have a semi-consistent posting schedule. Here is what I currently have planned for the month of February:

Of course, if I come across something else I find and want to talk about, I will. But this is what I have planned so far. I hope you all enjoy!

Feel free to leave any feedback or suggestions ~~in the comments below~~ [via email](mailto:yssaketh@gmail.com) (until I can set up a proper comments section <sub><sup>maybe I should make a post on that</sup></sub>). I'm fairly new to blogging, so I'm always looking to improve my content and this site. Thanks for reading!

## Planned Posts

- [ ] 2/12: <a href="javascript:alert('Post not out yet')">Repairing My School's Old Piano</a>
- [ ] 2/19: <a href="javascript:alert('Post not out yet')">Methodology for Teaching Collaborative Musical Improvisation to Classically-Trained Musicians</a>

## Other misc. updates to the site that I want to implement/ have planned:

1. Comments section
2. The cool "on hover" footnotes like what the [MIT Blog](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/we-are-reinstating-our-sat-act-requirement-for-future-admissions-cycles/#:~:text=I%20explain%20more%E2%81%A001%20about%20how) has
3. A way to subscribe to the blog
