Hello everyone! Over the last month, I've been working on building a backlog so that I can have a semi-consistent posting schedule. Here is what I currently have planned for the month of February:


## Planned Posts:

- [ ] 2/12: <a href="javascript:alert('Post will be published on 2/12/23')">Repairing My School's Old Piano</a>
- [ ] 2/25: <a href="javascript:alert('Post will be published on 2/25/23')">My Methodology for Teaching Collaborative Musical Improvisation to Classically Trained Musicians</a>

## Other misc. updates to the site that I want to implement/ have planned:

- [X] Comments section<font color ="#ef5350">: Giscus</font>
- [ ] The cool "on hover" footnotes like what the [MIT Blog](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/we-are-reinstating-our-sat-act-requirement-for-future-admissions-cycles/) has
- [ ] A way to subscribe to the blog

## Other notes:

Of course, if I come across something else I find and want to talk about, I'll likely post them or add them to my todo list. But this is what I have planned so far. I hope you all enjoy!

Feel free to leave any feedback or suggestions ~~in the comments below~~ [via email](mailto:yssaketh@gmail.com) (until I can set up a proper comments section <sub><sup>~~maybe I should make a post on that~~ I just set up the GitHub Discussions-based [giscus](https://giscus.app/). It was extremely easy and quick to set up, so I don't feel like it would really warrant it's own post</sup></sub>).

I'm fairly new to blogging, so I'm always looking to improve my content and this site. Thanks for reading!

\- Saketh
